        <h3>What is Castel ?</h3>

<p>Castel is a new programming language. It aims web developers, and try to address design flaws that we could find in Javascript or PHP. Its goal is to provide a robust environment which could be used as a client script engine, or as a server page generator.</p>

<p>Castel's compiler is build using some C++11 features and the <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> library. Please note that the project is currently <strong>very unstable</strong>, and that it should definitely not be used in a production environment.</p>

<h3>Why another programming language ?</h3>

<p>Even if <a href="http://xkcd.com/927/">XKCD</a> warns us against competing standards, sometimes it can be a good idea to look around, see the conception issues in current programming language, and try to address them. However, these language are often 'ready to prod', which means that there is very little chance that these design flaws will ever be fixed (every little design change would break backward compatibility for many users).</p>

<h3>This Castel does look like Python/Javascript/Java/<a href="http://www.gotopp.org/index.html.en">GOTO++</a>
</h3>

<p>Yes it does ! Actually, some of its syntaxes has been inspired by these languages. Why not ? It's not like it was a random patchwork of syntaxes : every single syntax has been carefully designed, and is the product of an intensive reflexion : "Does it make sense to include this feature ?".</p>

<h3>Who are the authors ? Can I join ?</h3>

<p>Castel's creator is <a href="https://github.com/arcanis" class="user-mention">@arcanis</a> and sure, you can join the project ! Fork repositories, push changes, make pull requests. Even creating issues would help us !</p>

<p>If you just want to support financially the development, you can also <a href="https://www.gittip.com/arcanis/">gittip</a> me. : )</p>
